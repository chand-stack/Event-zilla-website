#### Responsive Design Using Tailwind CSS, DaisyUI, and React JSX

module.exports = {
  content: [
    './src/**/*.{js,jsx,ts,tsx}',
    './public/index.html',
  ],
  theme: {
    extend: {},
  },
  plugins: [
    require('daisyui'),
  ],
}
`

Run the Tailwind CSS build process:

'
`npx tailwindcss build src/styles.css -o src/output.css
`
#### Use Tailwind CSS Classes in React JSX
Utilize Tailwind CSS classes directly in your React JSX components to style and structure the UI for responsiveness

#### Implement Responsive Classes
